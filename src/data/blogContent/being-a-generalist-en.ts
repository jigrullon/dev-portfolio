export const content = `## Specialization vs Generalism

This one is personal for me. Something I have struggled with for quite some time, with no real solution or path forward. In part because I do not know if there is one. The tension between specializing and remaining a generalist sits at the center of many modern careers, but nowhere is it felt more sharply than in technology. I've wrestled with it for years, unsure whether I even want an answer. If specialization is the path forward, what exactly would I be specializing in? And if generalism is the path, what does that look like in a world obsessed with increasingly narrow expertise?

## The Fragmented Landscape of Tech

Technology has splintered into countless domains: DevOps, backend engineering, frontend frameworks, AI research, cybersecurity, network engineering, data engineering, and many more. Each domain branches into subfields. AI alone gives you NLP, robotics, reinforcement learning, and computer vision. Frontend has its own universe of mobile work, design systems, and tooling. Gaming breaks into modeling, level design, engine work, and audio.

And that’s before considering the languages and platforms inside those subfields. You can specialize in data engineering on Snowflake instead of BigQuery, or infrastructure automation with Rust instead of Python. Even the naming of our roles changes so fast that a job title barely survives a year. DevOps, SRE, platform engineering, infrastructure engineering—pick your label of the month.

## The Tools and Titles Problem

What are the Different Types of Tools Used in DevOps?

DevOps tools. I mean, look at this. Look at it!
The tool fatigue is real. According to the Stack Overflow developer survey, over one third of devs are juggling 6-10 tools daily. That number feels low from where I’m standing. But beyond the exhaustion of learning and relearning toolchains, the deeper problem is impermanence. Roles vanish. Stacks lose relevance. Entire career paths evaporate almost overnight. You may still have your job and role for now, but the experience you’re getting is no longer helping you if you ever leave your company. Below you can see the roadmap just for DevOps Engineering.

Not legible, but this is the roadmap for a DevOps engineer. You get the idea.
Some of our roles and specialties are also dying right before our very eyes. DevOps has been “dead” for years now. Just look at a YouTube search and look at how many are from the last few months. Either being replaced by different roles, or just by AI in general like everything else. This gives more credence to the idea of not specializing, as that specialty may just go away one day. There’s a quiet fear beneath the surface of our profession: that we’re always one technology shift away from irrelevance, or one hiring cycle away from someone cheaper taking our spot. That fear fuels burnout, constant upskilling, and the fantasy of quitting it all to go build furniture or farm sweet potatoes somewhere peaceful.

## The Emotional Impact

I cannot help but admire and be envious of those who are artisans. They get to refine one craft repeatedly, growing more skilled with every swing of the hammer. In tech, we often don’t get that compounding growth. For us, the next day does not always build upon the one from yesterday. We jump from one project to an entirely different one. This may seem beneficial and even desirable, but if you’re not getting better, then what are you really doing?

I once spent a couple of months planning and executing a Jira migration. I have yet to do anything like that again since. I got very good at Jira permissions, settings, and workflows, but for what? That work became academic, like a math chapter you mastered for an exam and promptly forgot because life never asked for it again. I did not bring it with me to the next task which was totally different.

Then the pattern repeats. Going from Jira Cloud migration → fixing ETL pipelines → building an API feature in Java Spring Boot → redesigning a landing page → improving query performance on a Postgres database really isn’t getting you anywhere closer to where you want to be. It’s breadth, not depth. And when you do revisit something years later, the ecosystem has changed so much that your prior knowledge is a faded photograph. “Oh yeah I did something similar in 2019 but gosh it has been so long now.” So we are tortured by the obsolescence of our industry as well as our jobs.

## The Value of Generalism

Yet generalism has its strengths. Being a generalist can help you view problems differently. If you have experience solving different problems using different tools and methodologies, you won’t fall back on your usual patterns that may or may not be useful. You won’t always try to be the hammer in your problems. Sometimes you need a hacksaw or a screwdriver. Technically you can hammer your screws in, but did you really do the job right?

But there’s a nagging question: does ten years of working in dozens of small bursts across many domains equal one year of experience repeated ten times? Even though I have been writing Java since 2011, I am not an expert. I just use it when I have to then drop it again for months or years at a time until a new need arises again. Is that really a career? Am I really a veteran? Are you a veteran of Super Mario Bros. when you have spent 20 years beating World 1-1 through 1-3 over and over and over? How good are you really?

Am I truly seasoned, or am I someone who has played the first three levels of many games without ever reaching the tough boss encounters?

## The Career Identity Crisis

Is it possible to specialize in being a generalist? Is that a brand in and of itself? Swiss Army knives still sell very well despite not being as good as machetes and scissors in certain areas. They’re invaluable in their versatility.

Maybe breadth is itself a kind of expertise.
Maybe not being tied to a language or technology is an advantage, not a hinderance. 
Maybe I am the one thinking too linearly.

Still, growth in tech doesn’t resemble growth in strength training. In the gym, you build muscle by repeating the same movement patterns consistently. In engineering, repetition is rare. By the time you revisit a domain, it has been reshaped by new frameworks or rewritten best practices. I cannot build the physique I want this way. But maybe I can build a career this way. We cannot do the same things multiple times a week though in our line of work. If we can, we aren’t working on hard enough problems. You also cannot keep bringing the old stuff with you. There are simply not enough hours in the day or week to keep that all fresh.

So what is the solution? How do we keep building upon our previous work? Especially for those who do not get much of a say in what they get to work on each day or week. The needs of the business come first. Doesn’t matter if you want to build a Rust app if your company needs a Jira migration or the database is on the fritz. Building that kind of domain knowledge and dexterity can be useful too. So long as you can be intentional about where you put it to use.

Some people solve this through side work. The power of volume. At work, you deploy the two tier application one time and then move on to the maintenance phase. Whereas you can deploy the two tier application multiple times per week for different clients in your other business. Repetition leads to expertise, and expertise leads to leverage. You can make different choices around language and architecture when you reach this stage. This is what we all secretly crave. Now, when something like AI can deploy them better than you can, you do not panic, because you see the value. You can go one step above. You stop being the person who deploys applications—you become the one who builds the systems that deploy them.

This is what I encourage engineers to do. Figure out what that something is for you. It sucks that our 40 hour work week doesn’t actually help us build these skills a lot of the time, and we need to work several more hours on the side doing stuff like this. What choice do we have? This is the current hand we have been dealt so we need to play it. We need to be the men in the arena and keep pounding the rock until we get something we can actually use.

## A Potential Path Forward

Today, specialization exists for nearly everything: GPU cluster schedulers, Kubernetes operator authors, Rust-based WASM engineers, IAM governance specialists, and the emerging world of AIOps and MCP builders.

I’m standing at my own crossroads. I could lean into MCPs. Or specialize in AIOps. Or deepen into cloud migrations. Or sharpen my DevOps and Kubernetes work. Or focus on IAM. Or become more of an API engineer.

I don’t know which path is the right one yet. But I do know that whichever path I choose, the goal is to take the pieces I’ve accumulated and finally stack them, instead of dropping them the moment the project ends.

## Conclusion

Specialization creates sharp tools. Generalization creates adaptable ones. In a world where tech keeps reinventing itself, the real win might be choosing a direction where you can continuously build, layer by layer, even if you start from a place of broad experience.

Maybe the future belongs not to specialists or generalists, but to those who can become specialists on demand—people who can go deep when needed, zoom out when required, and carry the right pieces of experience forward instead of letting them fade.

And maybe that’s the real craft to master.
